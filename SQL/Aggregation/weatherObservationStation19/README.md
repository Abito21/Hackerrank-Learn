Consider P1(a, c) and P2(b, d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a, b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c, d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
